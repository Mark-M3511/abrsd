# ABR & SD Collective Web Project

This project is built using Drupal 10+, a powerful open-source content management system. It allows for the creation and management of various types of content such as blogs, news, and user content.

## Structure

A typical Drupal 10 project consists of several directories:

- `core`: This directory contains the main Drupal installation.

- `modules`: This directory contains all the modules used in the project. Modules extend the functionality of Drupal.

- `profiles`: This directory contains installation profiles, which define what modules and themes to enable, as well as default configuration values.

- `sites`: This directory contains the settings and files for your site. It usually includes a `default` subdirectory, containing `settings.php` (the main settings file) and `files` (for uploaded files).

- `themes`: This directory contains all the themes used in the project. Themes control the appearance of the site.

- `vendor`: This directory contains all the third-party libraries that the project depends on.

## Installation

To install a Drupal 10 project, you typically need to clone the project repository, navigate into the project directory, and install the dependencies. This can be done using Composer, a dependency management tool for PHP.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/username/project.git

# Navigate into the directory
cd project

# Install dependencies
composer install
